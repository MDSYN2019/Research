README:

Here is the C++ file I used for computing the free energy using the Jarzynsi Equality. More details on the background can be
found in main.cxx.

The work files can be found in the /data/ folder. The most important columns are column 2 and the last column (starting index 1), which represents
the reaction coordinate and the work values computed using LAMMPS.

Please contact me at Sangyoung123@googlemail.com for more information

Thanks
