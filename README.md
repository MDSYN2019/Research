PhD Molecular Dynamics analysis code 

This repository contains some of the code I used during period of my PhD, including free energy calculation codes, such as the Jarzynski Equality.

Work in this repository references the following works and books:

[2]. "Free energy reconstruction from nonequilibrium single-molecule pulling experiments", PNAS, 3658 - 3661, 98, 7, 2001
