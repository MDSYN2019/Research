Some further analysis that need to be implemented:


- Does budding only occur in mixed surfactant systems? i.e. test with a pure bilayer

- What is the budding ‘rate’? Plot z coordinate of the NP over time.

- Does budding correlate with de-mixing? How does the distribution of surfactants change as budding occurs? Does a certain amount of phase-separation trigger budding? What is the distribution of surfactant A and B around the NP and does this change as budding occurs?

- If we start the membrane in a phase-separated state, does budding still occur? (Or is it the dynamics process and starting out of equilibrium that provides the driving force?)

- We should do repeat simulations with different random starting distributions of the different surfactant types and see if we can extract the common features of budding.

- Is budding dependent on NP size?

- Is budding dependent on the strength of repulsion between A and B?

Need to ensure that this is executed in the main bash environment, and not within the
