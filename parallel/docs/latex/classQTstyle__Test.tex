\subsection{Detailed Description}
A test class -\/ find and replace from this template for future class definitions. 

One of the most common examples of concepts in quantitiative finance is that of a statistical distribtion. Random variables play a huge part in quantitive financial modelling. Derivatives, pricing, cash-\/flow forceasting and quantitive trading all make use of statitiscal methods in some fashion

Many of the chapters within this book have made use of random number generators in order to carry out pricing tasks.

In a nutshell, we are splitting the generation of (uniform integer) random numbers from draws of specific statistical distribution,s such taht we can use the statics classes elsewhere withut bringing along the heavy random number generation functions.

Equally useful is the fact taht we will be able to \char`\"{}swap out\char`\"{} different random number generators for out statisics classes for reliability, extensibility and efficiency
