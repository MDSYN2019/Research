Adopted from Zed Shaw's macros

Handling errors is a difficult actiivity in almost every programming langauge. There are entire programming languages 
that try as hard as they can to avoid even the concept of an error. Otjher languages invent complex control 
structures like exceptions to pass error conditions around.

C (C++) tackles the problem by returning error codes and setting a global errno value that you can check
