  \class SoQt SoQt.h Inventor/Qt/SoQt.h
  \brief The SoQt class takes care of Qt initialization and event dispatching.
  \ingroup misc

  This is the "application-wide" class with solely static methods
  handling initialization and event processing tasks. You must use
  this class in any application built on top of the SoQt
  library.

  Typical usage is as follows (complete application code):

  \code
  #include <Inventor/Qt/SoQt.h>
  #include <Inventor/Qt/viewers/SoQtExaminerViewer.h>
  #include <Inventor/nodes/SoBaseColor.h>
  #include <Inventor/nodes/SoCone.h>
  #include <Inventor/nodes/SoSeparator.h>
  
  int
  main(int argc, char ** argv)
  {
    // Initialize SoQt and Inventor API libraries. This returns a main
    // window to use.
    QWidget * mainwin = SoQt::init(argc, argv, argv[0]);
  
    // Make a dead simple scene graph, only containing a single
    // yellow cone under the scenegraph root.
    SoSeparator * root = new SoSeparator;
    root->ref();

    SoBaseColor * col = new SoBaseColor;
    col->rgb = SbColor(1, 1, 0);
    root->addChild(col);

    root->addChild(new SoCone);
  
    // Use one of the convenient viewer classes.
    SoQtExaminerViewer * eviewer = new SoQtExaminerViewer(mainwin);
    eviewer->setSceneGraph(root);
    eviewer->show();
  
    // Pop up the main window.
    SoQt::show(mainwin);
    // Loop until exit.
    SoQt::mainLoop();

    // Clean up resources.
    delete eviewer;
    root->unref();

    return 0;
  }
  \endcode

  And voila:

  application programmer should not call it explicitly unless she
  has taken control over the native event loop herself, and is
  therefore not using SoQt::mainLoop().

  (Even then it is usually not necessary to call this method, as the
  operating system should take care of cleaning up resource use when
  an application exits. This method is mainly provided as a manner to
  be able to clean up in "unusual" run-time environments, for instance
  if SoQt is used as a component in a browser plug-in.)
  -->

  It should never be invoked more than \e once, and that

*/

/*!
  \fn void SoQt::mainLoop(void)

  This is the event dispatch loop.

  It doesn't return until application exit is somehow forced, either
  programmatically from the relevant API-call of the native toolkit,
  or when the user closes the application's main widget.

  An important note: be careful about how you handle
  SoQtComponent-derived objects after the application control returns
  from mainLoop(), as SoQt will then have been "cleaned up" with
  regards to various internal resources. So doing for instance
  something like this:

  \code
  SoQt::mainLoop();
  viewer->hide();
  \endcode

  ..spells "undefined behavior, expect a crash".

  \e Deleting a component after mainLoop() returns is allowed, though,
  and also necessary to avoid getting reports of possible memory leaks
  from memleak checkers.

*/

/*!
  Set up a callback to invoke in the case of unexpected fatal error
  conditions within the SoQt library.

  Almost any error condition within the library is handled in a robust
  way through return values indicating errors for the offending calls,
  but there are a few cases that are impossible to handle without
  seriously crippling the functionality.

  (One example is if we fail to find \e any way of making a valid
  OpenGL canvas. This is an indication that something is seriously
  wrong on the end-user's system, and the SoQt library will not work
  properly.)

  In the case of a fatal error, it is expected that the given
  application callback function communicates the problem to the
  end-user and then either exits the application or at least refrains
  from using any part of the SoQt library.

  If no callback is explicitly set up by the application, the SoQt
  library will display an error message to the end-user and then exit
  the application.

  When setting a callback, this method returns a pointer to the
  previous callback function, or \c NULL if none.

  (This is an extension versus the original SGI InventorXt library
  API.)


  On a related note, be aware that the end-user will still be notified
  about non-fatal errors and warning messages through a dialog box. If
  you want to handle these yourself, or if you don't want your
  end-user to see any of these non-critical messages, you will also
  need to install an error handler callback function on the Coin
  library itself:

  \code
    SoDebugError::setHandlerCallback(myErrorHandlerCB, myCBUserData);
  \endcode

  (Please also see the documentation of
  SoDebugError::setHandlerCallback().)
